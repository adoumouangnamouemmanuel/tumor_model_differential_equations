  <h3>An interactive exploration of mathematical models in cancer research</h3>
</div>

## üåü Overview

This project presents an interactive web platform for exploring the Nonlinear Tumor-Immune Unstable Hybrid Dynamical Model (NTIUNHDM), a sophisticated mathematical framework designed to investigate the complex interactions between tumor cells, immune response, and dietary factors. Through differential equations and numerical methods, we demonstrate how these biological systems interact and how lifestyle choices can influence cancer development and progression.

The platform combines rigorous mathematical modeling with intuitive visualizations, making complex concepts accessible to researchers, students, and the general public.
